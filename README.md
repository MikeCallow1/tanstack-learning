# TanStack Learning Repository

This repository is a Vite-bootstrapped React TypeScript project created for learning and experimenting with the TanStack libraries: Router, Query, and Form.

## Vite
Vite is a modern frontend build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience. It leverages native ES modules in the browser for lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and builds your project using Rollup for optimized production bundles.

## Overview of TanStack Libraries

### TanStack Router
TanStack Router is a powerful and type-safe routing library for React. It provides a flexible way to define routes, manage navigation, and handle dynamic parameters, all while ensuring type safety throughout your application.

### TanStack Query
TanStack Query is a data-fetching and state management library for React. It simplifies working with server-side data by providing tools for caching, background updates, and synchronization, making it easier to manage asynchronous data in your application.

### TanStack Form
TanStack Form is a form management library designed for React. It focuses on providing a type-safe and declarative way to handle form state, validation, and submission, making it easier to build complex forms with minimal boilerplate.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MikeCallow1/tanstack-learning.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Learning Goals
